Purpose - begin javascript client objects


a) two.js - globals

b) two-com.js - a wrapper around XMLHttpRequest to communicate with the mother ship, web server

c) two-css.js - where css style are categorized under place, position,background, size,cursor namespaces ... you essentially place with border and manage display within place namespace, size.setwidth and so on.

That's about what we are using to create applications at this point on the client end. 

On the server end, we have more exciting things check out madhukumarseshadri/talkweb3

I think evolution of CSS need to be managed via namespaces for category of styles place, position,background, size,cursor namespaces as it will be lot more easy to manage them as they grow.
